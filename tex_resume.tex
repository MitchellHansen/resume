\section{Experience}
\cventry{July 2017 -- Present}{Software Developer}{Espial}{Kirkland, WA}{}{
At Espial I learned how to effectively develop for embedded linux products. This includes bugfixing,
reading and understanding legacy C++, automation, and other duties related to maintaining a large
hardware/software product. Later in my time at Espial I also was given the opportunity to work on a 
large cloud SaaS solution which provided cable operators an interface for managing millions of devices.
}
\cventry{June 2016 -- Sept. 2016}{Full Stack Web Developer, Intern}{Donuts Inc.}{Bellevue, WA}{}{
At Donuts I learned the basics of how software development worked and how Agile development is
applied to get effective solutions. I spent the majority of my time writing multiple micro apps
using Googles cloud services and Python.
}

\section{Education}
\cventry{2012--2017}{B.S. in Computer Science}{Central Washington University}{Ellensburg, WA}{}{}  % arguments 3 to 6 can be left empty
\cventry{1990's - Present}{Self-Taught}{}{}{}{I'm a lifelong learner and love all things tech. I program as a hobby, love learning new things, and am always up for a challenge.}
\section{Skills \& Languages}

\cventry{}{In depth knowledge / Professional experience}{}{}{}{
	C++, OpenCL, Python, Linux
}

\cventry{}{Enough to be dangerous}{}{}{}{
	Java, SQL, Javascript, HTML \& CSS, 3D Graphics, Android, Git / Perforce

}

\cventry{}{Great grokker}{}{}{}{
	In the end, programming is programming, it's all really the same. I take pride in my ability to pick up on new tech / languages extremely quickly, and problem solve my way out of difficult situations. I hope that my portfolio / work experience demonstrates this fact more so than just words can convey.
