\section{Experience}
\cventry{Dec 2018 -- Present}{Embedded Software Developer}{Elektrobit}{Bothell, WA}{}{
At my current and lovely company Elektrobit, I am tasked with supporting our Tresos and Corbos implementations of the Autosar automotive standard. This support takes many forms; Dealing with low level debugging of automotive ECU's, from assembly to the OS architecture. Painstakingly fact checking configurations against CPU spec sheets. Or even sprinkling in a little onsite customer support as an Autosar SME.
}

\cventry{July 2017 -- Dec 2018}{Software Developer (Embedded / Full Stack Web)}{Espial}{Kirkland, WA}{}{
At Espial I initially applied my knowledge of embedded products and C/C++ to hunt for bugs
in a legacy set-top-box C++ codebase. I also aided in maintenance of the test automation 
framework for said codebase. I later pivoted to another role in the cloud services team, in which we 
performed all the engineering required for maintaining and developing a large IPTV SaaS solution. This 
included bug fixes, feature work, automation (test\&build), releases, and if we were unlucky, cm and ops.
}

\cventry{June 2016 -- Sept. 2016}{Full Stack Web Developer, Intern}{Donuts Inc.}{Bellevue, WA}{}{
At Donuts I wrote bad html/css, and bad javascript. I still write bad html/css/js. I also learned that I'd rather move my career more in the direction of embedded development.
